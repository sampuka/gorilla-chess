Chess AI engine for university project. Contains both backend data structures, move generation etc, and several search strategies.

Brief conclusion: Poor memory optimization, but fast move generation. Only search strategy found to be usable is alpha-beta-pruning. Many small/medium issues and lack of features such as transposition table. Most of them would be best implemented in a rewrite.
